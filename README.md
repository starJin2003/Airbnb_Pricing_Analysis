# Airbnb_Pricing_Analysis

## Background
A place to stay on a trip is essential. In the past, only hotels used to provide such services, but Airbnb has become a trend now. After COVID-19, the number of people traveling to other countries increased. And “Airbnb saw its revenues increase by 73% in 2021, after a 31% decrease in revenue in 2020 due the coronavirus pandemic shutting down travel. (Home App Data Airbnb Revenue and Usage Statistics (2023), n.d.). There are many reasons why Airbnb continues to become famous, but the main reason is that “they are cheaper and provide better service than hotels (Baker, 2022).”

## Target Users
The target users who want to see this analysis are 1) hosts who don't know how to set their Airbnb price, 2) guests who want to know if the Airbnb they picked is overpriced, and 3) other travel platforms who want to understand how the Airbnb pricing works.


## Objective
Our primary goal is to predict the price of an Airbnb based on its features. The realization of the reason Airbnb became famous has made us think of a question: what factors make Airbnb's services cheaper and on what basis do hosts set their own Airbnb’s price? Thus, we will try to understand the factors influencing Airbnb prices and create a predictive model that estimates the price of an Airbnb listing with its features. This will enable hosts to reasonably price their properties, guests to identify fairly priced accommodations, and other travel platforms to gain insights into Airbnb's pricing strategies.
